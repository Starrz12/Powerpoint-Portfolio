# Powerpoint-Portfolio
## I needed to give a presentation of my experience in "Tech-Moms" course and wanted it to appear like a powerpoint presentation- even though it's a website
First I decided generally how many pages I wanted & what information would go on each page. Then I made a wireframe type mockup of each page in PowerPoint. Then I got to coding! I started with the Intro page & built in the same order I planned to present.<br>
<br>
**My "presentation Slides"**<br>
- An Introduction Page: Everyone has an opening powerpoint slide with almost no info on it. It mainly primes the mood for the presentation
- Tech-Moms Introduction Page: I talk about the course: my experience, the location, child care, & include a picture of my cohort
- LinkedIn & GitHub: I wanted to showcase two amazing tools we learned how to use during the course. I included an embeded LinkedIn widget as well as a screen shot of my LinkedIn profile & growing connections. For GitHub I also took a screenshot of my profile & repositories
- FreeCodeCamp: I showcased FreeCode camp as an amazing source of knowledge & displayed my certificate for completing their responsive web design course. I also included screenshots of some of the projects I completed for the course.
- FamilyTravel: This showcases my FamilyTravel project (code can be found in another repository). I include screenshots for some of the pages as well as snapshots of my code.
- Digital Nature: This "slide" showcases my DigitalNature project (code can be found in another repository). I include screenshots for some of the pages as well as snapshots of my code.
- Learning: Sum up some of the important things I learned in the course. Each slide has mostly pictures & few words to act as aids in the presentation I gave (just like a powerpoint presentation! Noticing a theme yet?!)
- Future: This slide gives my contact info as well as referencing my current & future plans in tech.

This project was extremely fun to make & allowed me to play around with CSS capabilities a lot more. Most of the slides are divided into a 3x3 grid with smaller portion boxes with each item flexed in rows or columns.
